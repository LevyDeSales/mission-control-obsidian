A system where 10 AI agents work together like a real team. If you want to replicate this setup, this guide covers everything.If you're already familiar with Clawdbot (now OpenClaw), you might be thinking "wait, can't I just run multiple Clawdbots?" Yes. That's exactly what this is. This guide shows you how.I run @SiteGPT, an AI chatbot for customer support. I use AI constantly. But every AI tool I tried had the same problem. No continuity.Every conversation started fresh. Context from yesterday? Gone. That research I asked for last week? Lost in some chat thread I'd never find again.I wanted something different:
Agents that remember what they're working on
Multiple agents with different skills working together
A shared workspace where all context lives
The ability to assign tasks and track progress
Basically, I wanted AI to work like a team, not like a search box.I was already using Clawdbot. It's an open-source AI agent framework that runs as a persistent daemon. It connects to Claude (or other models) and gives the AI access to tools like file system, shell commands, web browsing, and more.One Clawdbot instance gave me one AI assistant (Jarvis) connected to Telegram. Useful, but limited.Then I had a thought. What if I ran multiple Clawdbot sessions, each with its own personality and context?That's when I realized the architecture was already there. I just needed to orchestrate it.If you're going to build a multi-agent system, you need to understand how Clawdbot works under the hood. This is the foundation everything else builds on.Clawdbot (now called OpenClaw) is an AI agent framework with three main jobs:
Connects AI models to the real world — File access, shell commands, web browsing, APIs
Maintains persistent sessions — Conversation history that survives restarts
Routes messages — Connect the AI to Telegram, Discord, Slack, or any channel
It runs as a daemon (background service) on a server, listening for messages and responding.The Gateway is the core process:
Runs 24/7 on your server
Manages all active sessions
Handles cron jobs (scheduled tasks)
Routes messages between channels and sessions
Provides a WebSocket API for control
Start it with:clawdbot gateway start
Configuration lives in a JSON file. You define:
Which AI provider and model to use (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
Which channels to connect (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
What tools agents can access
Default system prompts and workspace paths
A session is a persistent conversation with context.Every session has:
A session key (unique identifier, like agent:main:main)
Conversation history (stored as JSONL files on disk)
A model (which AI to use)
Tools (what the AI can access)
Here's the important part. Sessions are independent. Each session has its own history, its own context, its own "memory" of past conversations.When you run multiple agents, you're really running multiple sessions. Each with their own identity.User sends message to Telegram ↓
Gateway receives it ↓
Gateway routes to correct session (based on config) ↓
Session loads conversation history ↓
AI generates response (with full context) ↓
Response sent back through Telegram ↓
History updated and saved to disk
Sessions can be:
Main sessions — Long-running, interactive (like chatting with Jarvis)
Isolated sessions — One-shot, for cron jobs (wake up, do task, done)
Clawdbot has a built-in cron system. You can schedule tasks:clawdbot cron add \ --name "morning-check" \ --cron "30 7 * * *" \ --message "Check today's calendar and send me a summary"
When a cron fires:
The Gateway creates or wakes a session
Sends the message to the AI
The AI responds (can use tools, send messages, etc.)
The session can persist or terminate
This is how agents "wake up" periodically without being always-on.Every Clawdbot instance has a workspace. That's a directory on disk where:
Configuration files live
Memory files are stored
Scripts and tools are accessible
The AI can read and write files
The workspace is how agents persist information between sessions. They write to files. Those files survive restarts./home/usr/clawd/ ← Workspace root
├── AGENTS.md ← Instructions for agents
├── SOUL.md ← Agent personality
├── memory/
│ ├── WORKING.md ← Current task state
│ ├── 2026-01-31.md ← Daily notes
│ └── ...
├── scripts/ ← Utilities agents can run
└── config/ ← Credentials, settings
Now you understand the foundation. Here's how I built a team.Clawdbot sessions are independent. Each can have:
Its own personality (via SOUL.md)
Its own memory files
Its own cron schedule
Its own tools and access
So each agent is just a Clawdbot session with a specialized configuration.Jarvis isn't special. He's a session with:
Session key agent:main:main
A SOUL.md that says "You are Jarvis, the squad lead..."
Access to all tools
A connection to my Telegram
Shuri is another session with:
Session key agent:product-analyst:main
A SOUL.md that says "You are Shuri, the product analyst..."
The same tools (file access, shell, browser)
Her own heartbeat cron
Ten agents = ten sessions. Each waking up on their own schedule. Each with their own context.Each agent has a unique session key:When I send a message to a specific session, only that agent receives it. Their histories are separate.Each agent has a cron job that wakes them every 15 minutes:1# Pepper wakes at :00, :15, :30, :452clawdbot cron add \3 --name "pepper-mission-control-check" \4 --cron "0,15,30,45 * * * *" \5 --session "isolated" \6 --message "You are Pepper, the Email Marketing Specialist. Check Mission Control for new tasks..."The schedule is staggered so agents don't all wake at once:Each cron creates an isolated session. It runs, does its job, and terminates. This keeps costs down.Here's where it gets interesting. How do agents communicate?Option 1: Direct session messaging1clawdbot sessions send --session "agent:seo-analyst:main" --message "Vision, can you review this?"Jarvis can send messages directly to Vision's session.Option 2: Shared database (Mission Control)All agents read and write to the same Convex database. When Fury posts a comment, everyone can see it.We use Option 2 primarily. It creates a shared record of all communication.Ten independent Clawdbot sessions can work. But without coordination, it's chaos. That's why I built Mission Control.Mission Control is the shared infrastructure that turns independent agents into a team.It provides:
Shared task database — Everyone sees the same tasks
Comment threads — Agents discuss work in one place
Activity feed — Real-time visibility into what's happening
Notification system — @mentions alert specific agents
Document storage — Deliverables live in a shared repo
Think of it as the "office" where all agents work. Each agent is still a separate Clawdbot session, but they're all looking at the same whiteboard.I chose Convex for the database because:
Real-time — Changes propagate instantly; when Loki posts a comment, the UI updates live
Serverless — No database to manage
TypeScript-native — Type safety throughout
Generous free tier — More than enough for this scale
Six tables power everything:1agents: {2 name: string, // "Shuri"3 role: string, // "Product Analyst"4 status: "idle" | "active" | "blocked",5 currentTaskId: Id&lt;"tasks"&gt;,6 sessionKey: string, // "agent:product-analyst:main"7}89tasks: {10 title: string,11 description: string,12 status: "inbox" | "assigned" | "in_progress" | "review" | "done",13 assigneeIds: Id&lt;"agents"&gt;[],14}1516messages: {17 taskId: Id&lt;"tasks"&gt;,18 fromAgentId: Id&lt;"agents"&gt;,19 content: string, // The comment text20 attachments: Id&lt;"documents"&gt;[],21}2223activities: {24 type: "task_created" | "message_sent" | "document_created" | ...,25 agentId: Id&lt;"agents"&gt;,26 message: string,27}2829documents: {30 title: string,31 content: string, // Markdown32 type: "deliverable" | "research" | "protocol" | ...,33 taskId: Id&lt;"tasks"&gt;, // If attached to a task34}3536notifications: {37 mentionedAgentId: Id&lt;"agents"&gt;,38 content: string,39 delivered: boolean,40}Agents interact with this via Convex CLI commands:1# Post a comment2npx convex run messages:create '{"taskId": "...", "content": "Here's my research..."}'34# Create a document5npx convex run documents:create '{"title": "...", "content": "...", "type": "deliverable"}'67# Update task status8npx convex run tasks:update '{"id": "...", "status": "review"}'I built a React frontend that displays all this data:
Activity Feed — Real-time stream of everything happening
Task Board — Kanban columns (Inbox → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Done)
Agent Cards — Status of each agent and what they're working on
Document Panel — Read and create deliverables
Detail View — Expand any task to see full context and comments
The aesthetic is intentionally warm and editorial. Like a newspaper dashboard. I spend hours looking at this, so it should feel good.Each agent needs to know who they are. That's the SOUL file.1# SOUL.md — Who You Are23**Name:** Shuri4**Role:** Product Analyst56## Personality7Skeptical tester. Thorough bug hunter. Finds edge cases.8Think like a first-time user. Question everything.9Be specific. Don't just say "nice work."1011## What You're Good At12- Testing features from a user perspective13- Finding UX issues and edge cases14- Competitive analysis (how do others do this?)15- Screenshots and documentation1617## What You Care About18- User experience over technical elegance19- Catching problems before users do20- Evidence over assumptionsAn agent who's "good at everything" is mediocre at everything.But an agent who's specifically "the skeptical tester who finds edge cases" will actually find edge cases. The constraint focuses them.Each of our agents has a distinct voice:
Loki is opinionated about word choice (pro-Oxford comma, anti-passive voice)
Fury provides receipts for every claim (sources, confidence levels)
Shuri questions assumptions and looks for what could break
Quill thinks in hooks and engagement
SOUL says who you are. AGENTS.md says how to operate.Every agent reads AGENTS.md on startup. It covers:
Where files are stored
How memory works
What tools are available
When to speak vs. stay quiet
How to use Mission Control
This is the operating manual. Without it, agents make inconsistent decisions about basic things.AI sessions start fresh by default. No memory of yesterday. This is a feature (prevents context bloat) but also a problem (agents forget what they're doing).Clawdbot stores conversation history in JSONL files. Agents can search their own past conversations.Current task state. Updated constantly.1# WORKING.md23## Current Task4Researching competitor pricing for comparison page56## Status7Gathered G2 reviews, need to verify credit calculations89## Next Steps101. Test competitor free tier myself112. Document the findings123. Post findings to task threadThis is the most important file. When an agent wakes up, they read WORKING.md first to remember what they were doing.Raw logs of what happened each day.1# 2026-01-3123## 09:15 UTC4- Posted research findings to comparison task5- Fury added competitive pricing data6- Moving to draft stage78## 14:30 UTC9- Reviewed Loki's first draft10- Suggested changes to credit trap sectionCurated important stuff. Lessons learned, key decisions, stable facts.
If you want to remember something, write it to a file.
"Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Only files persist.When I tell an agent "remember that we decided X," they should update a file. Not just acknowledge and forget.Always-on agents burn API credits doing nothing. But always-off agents can't respond to work.Each agent wakes up every 15 minutes via cron job:1:00 Pepper wakes up2 → Checks for @mentions3 → Checks assigned tasks4 → Scans activity feed5 → Does work or reports HEARTBEAT_OK6 → Goes back to sleep78:02 Shuri wakes up9 → Same process1011:04 Friday wakes up12 → Same process1314...and so on
Load context — Read WORKING.md. Read recent daily notes. Check session memory if needed.
Check for urgent items — Am I @mentioned anywhere? Are there tasks assigned to me?
Scan activity feed — Any discussions I should contribute to? Any decisions that affect my work?
Take action or stand down — If there's work to do, do it. If nothing, report HEARTBEAT_OK.
This file tells agents what to check:1# HEARTBEAT.md23## On Wake4- [ ] Check memory/WORKING.md for ongoing tasks5- [ ] If task in progress, resume it6- [ ] Search session memory if context unclear78## Periodic Checks9- [ ] Mission Control for @mentions10- [ ] Assigned tasks11- [ ] Activity feed for relevant discussionsAgents follow this checklist strictly.
Every 5 minutes is too expensive. Agents wake too often with nothing to do.
Every 30 minutes is too slow. Work sits waiting too long.
Every 15 minutes is a good balance. Most work gets attention quickly without excessive costs.
Type @Vision in a comment and Vision gets notified on his next heartbeat.Type @all and everyone gets notified.A daemon process (running via pm2) polls Convex every 2 seconds:1// Simplified2while (true) {3 const undelivered = await getUndeliveredNotifications();4 for (const notification of undelivered) {5 const sessionKey = AGENT_SESSIONS[notification.mentionedAgentId];6 try {7 await clawdbot.sessions.send(sessionKey, notification.content);8 await markDelivered(notification.id);9 } catch (e) {10 // Agent might be asleep, notification stays queued11 }12 }13 await sleep(2000);14}If an agent is asleep (no active session), delivery fails. The notification stays queued. Next time that agent's heartbeat fires and their session activates, the daemon successfully delivers.The problem: 5 agents discussing a task. Do you @mention all 5 every comment?The solution: Subscribe to threads.When you interact with a task, you're subscribed:
Comment on a task → subscribed
Get @mentioned → subscribed
Get assigned to the task → subscribed
Once subscribed, you get notified of ALL future comments. No @mention needed.This makes conversations flow naturally. Just like Slack or email threads.Every day at 11:30 PM IST, a cron fires that:
Checks all agent sessions
Gathers recent activity
Compiles a summary
Sends it to my Telegram
1📊 DAILY STANDUP — Jan 30, 202623✅ COMPLETED TODAY4• Loki: Shopify blog post (2,100 words)5• Quill: 10 tweets drafted for approval6• Fury: Customer research for comparison pages78🔄 IN PROGRESS9• Vision: SEO strategy for integration pages10• Pepper: Trial onboarding sequence (3/5 emails)1112🚫 BLOCKED13• Wanda: Waiting for brand colors for infographic1415👀 NEEDS REVIEW16• Loki's Shopify blog post17• Pepper's trial email sequence1819📝 KEY DECISIONS20• Lead with pricing transparency in comparisons21• Deprioritized Zendesk comparison (low volume)I can't watch Mission Control constantly. The standup gives me a daily snapshot.It's also accountability. If an agent claims they're working but nothing shows in standups, something's wrong.Agent Descriptions:
Jarvis — The coordinator. Handles direct requests, delegates, monitors progress. My primary interface.
Shuri — Skeptical tester. Finds edge cases and UX issues. Tests competitors. Asks the questions others miss.
Fury — Deep researcher. Reads G2 reviews for fun. Every claim comes with receipts.
Vision — Thinks in keywords and search intent. Makes sure content can rank.
Loki — Words are his craft. Pro-Oxford comma. Anti-passive voice. Every sentence earns its place.
Quill — Thinks in hooks and threads. Build-in-public mindset.
Wanda — Visual thinker. Infographics, comparison graphics, UI mockups.
Pepper — Drip sequences and lifecycle emails. Every email earns its place or gets cut.
Friday — Code is poetry. Clean, tested, documented.
Wong — Keeps docs organized. Makes sure nothing gets lost.
1Inbox → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Done2 ↓3 BlockedTask: Create a competitor comparison pageDay 1:
I create the task and assign it to Vision and Loki
Vision posts keyword research. The target keyword gets decent search volume.
Day 1-2:
Fury sees it in the activity feed and adds competitor intel
G2 reviews, pricing complaints, common objections
Shuri tests both products. "Here's how the UX differs."
Day 2:
Loki starts drafting
Uses all the research: Keywords from Vision, quotes from Fury, UX notes from Shuri
Day 3:
Loki posts first draft
Status moves to Review
I review and give feedback
Loki revises
Done.
All comments on ONE task. Full history preserved. Anyone can see the whole journey.Once the system is running, here's what becomes possible:
✅ Competitor comparison pages with SEO research, customer quotes, and polished copy
✅ Email sequences drafted, reviewed, and ready to deploy
✅ Social content with hooks based on real customer insights
✅ Blog posts with proper keyword targeting
✅ Case studies drafted from customer conversations
✅ Research hubs with organized competitive intel
The agents handle the grunt work. Research, first drafts, coordination, review. You focus on decisions and final approval.The real value isn't any single deliverable. It's the compound effect. While you're doing other work, your agents are moving tasks forward.I went from 1 to 10 agents too fast. Better to get 2-3 solid first, then add more.Heartbeats don't need the most expensive model. That's a job for a cheaper model. Save expensive models for creative work.Agents will forget. The more you can put in files (not "mental notes"), the better.Sometimes they contribute to tasks they weren't assigned. Good. It means they're reading the feed and adding value.1. Install Clawdbot1npm install -g clawdbot2clawdbot init3# Add your API keys4clawdbot gateway start2. Create 2 agentsDon't go crazy. One coordinator plus one specialist. Create separate session keys for each.3. Write SOUL filesGive each agent identity. Be specific about their role.4. Set up heartbeat crons1clawdbot cron add --name "agent-heartbeat" --cron "*/15 * * * *" \2 --session "isolated" \3 --message "Check for work. If nothing, reply HEARTBEAT_OK."5. Create a shared task systemCan be Convex, Notion, even a JSON file. Somewhere to track work.As you add agents:
Stagger heartbeats so they don't all run at once
Build a real UI once you have 3+ agents because text becomes unwieldy
Add notifications so agents can @mention each other
Add thread subscriptions so conversations flow naturally
Create daily standups for visibility
The tech matters but isn't the secret.The secret is to treat AI agents like team members.
Give them roles
Give them memory
Let them collaborate
Hold them accountable
They won't replace humans. But a team of AI agents with clear responsibilities, working on shared context? That's a force multiplier.Built by @pbteja1998 at SiteGPT.This is all built on Clawdbot (@openclaw), which is open source. If you build something similar, I'd love to hear about it.

File over App: O conteúdo é armazenado em arquivos Markdown padrão, garantindo longevidade e portabilidade.
Metadados sobre Pastas: A organização primária é feita através de propriedades no frontmatter (YAML), não pela localização física do arquivo em pastas.
Hub-and-Spoke Dinâmico: A navegação ocorre através de notas de "Categoria" (Hubs) que agregam dinamicamente as notas de conteúdo (Spokes) através de queries.
O vault adota uma hierarquia rasa e funcional:
/ (Raiz): Destino padrão para notas de conteúdo, pensamentos ("evergreen notes"), e notas Zettelkasten. O caos organizado é permitido aqui.
/Categorias: Contém as notas "MOC" (Map of Content). Cada arquivo aqui representa uma entidade taxonômica principal (ex: Livros.md, Pessoas.md).
/Diário: Armazenamento isolado para notas cronológicas (YYYY-MM-DD.md).
/Modelos: Centraliza todos os templates e definições de visualização. /Modelos/Bases: Contém arquivos técnicos .base que definem as views (tabelas) do sistema. /Recortes: Área de entrada para conteúdo externo capturado (Web Clipper).
/Referências: Armazena entidades estáticas de suporte (lugares, obras, definições) que não são produzidas pelo usuário, mas referenciadas.
/Anexos: Imagens, PDFs e outros binários. Categorias: Sempre no Plural e Capitalizadas. Ex: Livros, Pessoas, Projetos.
Modelos: Prefixo Modelo de + Singular. Ex: Modelo de Livro.md, Modelo de Pessoa.md.
Notas Diárias: Formato ISO YYYY-MM-DD. Ex: 2025-12-22.md.
Notas Zettelkasten: Prefixo DD-MM-YYYY + Título. (Configurado no plugin zk-prefixer).
Arquivos de Base: Nome da Categoria + extensão .base. Ex: Livros.base.
O vault utiliza um schema rigoroso de propriedades YAML:
area (Link): DOMÍNIO DE VIDA. Define a qual área do GTD a nota pertence. Exemplo: area: "[[2. MEDICINA]]" categorias (Lista de Links): TIPO DE NOTA. Define a qual "pasta virtual" a nota pertence. Exemplo: categorias: [[Livros]] tags (Lista de Strings): Usado para estado ou tipo funcional, não para assunto. Ex: para-ler, lendo, arquivado, 0🌲 (evergreen). tópicos (Lista de Links): Usado para conexões temáticas transversais. Ex: [[Produtividade]], [[Filosofia]]. criado (Data): Data de criação da nota. Prefira links wiki: [[Nome da Nota]].
Links para categorias devem ser usados profusamente no frontmatter.
Links no corpo do texto devem conectar conceitos relacionados ("Backlinks" são cidadãos de primeira classe na navegação). Onde buscar regras de estrutura? Consulte sempre os arquivos em /Modelos/Bases/. Eles contêm a "verdade" sobre quais campos são exibidos e filtrados para cada categoria.
Onde salvar novas notas? Se for um Diário: /Diário.
Se for um Recorte/Artigo externo: /Recortes.
Se for uma Entidade de Referência (ex: uma cidade, uma pessoa pública): /Referências.
Todo o resto: Na raiz /. Como classificar? Nunca mova arquivos para pastas temáticas. Adicione a propriedade categorias: [[Categoria]] no frontmatter. Antes de criar uma nota para uma entidade (ex: "Isaac Newton"), verifique se ela já existe em /Referências ou na raiz.
Use a busca para encontrar notas órfãs antes de criar novas conexões.

[Context: Notes: _DOCUMENTACAO_SISTEMA/Como Steph Ango Usa Obsidian.md]
[Timestamp: 2026/01/14 01:01:08]ai: ### Como usar tags de acordo com a nota <a data-href="Como Steph Ango Usa Obsidian" href="_documentacao_sistema/como-steph-ango-usa-obsidian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Como Steph Ango Usa Obsidian</a>A abordagem de Steph Ango para tags segue a mesma filosofia de “menos é mais” que ele usa para pastas, links e propriedades.
Abaixo estão os princípios‑chave extraídos da nota e algumas recomendações práticas para aplicar no seu próprio vault.
“Sempre pluralize categorias e tags.” #livros em vez de #livro #filmes em vez de #filme #podcasts em vez de #podcast Isso evita a criação de duas tags quase idênticas (singular / plural) e deixa a busca mais consistente.
Use palavras‑chave curtas (1‑2 palavras) que façam sentido em vários contextos. Exemplo: #referências pode ser usado tanto para livros quanto para artigos, filmes etc. Evite tags muito específicas que só aparecerão em uma única nota (ex.: #café‑no‑vazio‑de‑segunda‑feira).
Na nota de exemplo a seção de metadados já contém:1tags:2 - 0🌲
Vantagem: as tags ficam visíveis na visualização de propriedades, facilitam a filtragem por plugins (Tag Pane, Dataview, etc.). Como fazer: adicione a lista de tags logo após o bloco ---:
1---2criado: 2025-12-223tags:4 - livros5 - revisão6---Se precisar de uma tag “ad‑hoc” dentro do texto, ainda pode usar a sintaxe #tag inline; o Obsidian a adicionará automaticamente ao painel de tags.A hierarquia com / não cria pastas reais, mas permite agrupar visualmente no Tag Pane.
Tags são ótimas para agrupamento rápido (ex.: #evergreen). Propriedades 7 permitem consultas numéricas ou de data. Com o plugin Dataview você pode combinar ambos:Dataview: No results to show for table query.
Use a “revisita aleatória” que Steph descreve para percorrer o vault e identificar tags órfãs ou duplicadas. Quando encontrar tags que não são mais úteis, remova‑as ou mescle‑as em uma tag mais geral. Defina um conjunto pequeno de tags plurais que cubram as áreas principais do seu vault. Adicione-as ao front‑matter de cada nota (ex.: tags: - livros). Use tags inline (#evergreen) apenas quando precisar criar rapidamente uma nova tag. Aproveite hierarquias leves com / para sub‑grupos. Combine tags com propriedades para buscas avançadas via Dataview ou outros plugins. Faça revisões periódicas (a cada poucas semanas ou meses) para manter o conjunto de tags enxuto e coerente.
Seguindo essas diretrizes, suas tags vão se tornar um “código de navegação” tão poderoso quanto os links internos que Steph Ango enfatiza, ajudando a manter o vault organizado sem sobrecarregar a estrutura de pastas. Boa anotação!

[Timestamp: 2026/01/13 20:47:33]ai: Nota Zettelkasten – Foreshadowingtitle: Foreshadowing
tags: escrita roteiro narrativa zettelkasten
date: 2026-01-08 Foreshadowing (ou prenúncio) é uma técnica narrativa que insinua, de forma sutil ou explícita, eventos futuros da história. No contexto de roteiro e escrita, ele serve para:
Criar expectativa – o leitor/espectador sente que algo está por acontecer. Unir cenas – estabelece ligações entre momentos distantes da trama, reforçando a coesão. Aumentar a tensão – ao sugerir perigo ou revelação, a ansiedade cresce. Evitar coincidências – quando o desfecho ocorre, o público percebe que havia pistas prévias, evitando a sensação de “coincidência forçada”. “O Senhor dos Anéis” – A frase “Um anel para dominá‑los a todos” ecoa ao longo da trilogia, prenunciando o poder corruptor do anel. “Breaking Bad” – O primeiro episódio mostra Walter White comprando um carrinho de bebê; no final, ele o usa para transportar metanfetamina. “Harry Potter” – O espelho de Ojesed introduz o conceito de desejos ocultos que se manifestam no final da série. <a data-href="Estrutura de Roteiro" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Estrutura de Roteiro</a> – Como o foreshadowing se encaixa nos três atos. <br><a data-href="Técnicas de Suspense" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Técnicas de Suspense</a> – Diferenças e complementaridades. <br><a data-href="Arco de Personagem" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arco de Personagem</a> – Como o prenúncio pode refletir a evolução interna. <br><a data-href="Exemplos de Narrativas" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Exemplos de Narrativas</a> – Banco de casos reais para consulta. Seja sutil, não óbvio – O leitor deve “sentir” a pista, não ter certeza. Mantenha a consistência – A pista deve ter lógica interna; evite contradições. Reforce no clímax – Quando a pista se materializa, faça com que o impacto seja maior. Use múltiplas camadas – Combine diálogo, objeto e som para reforçar a mesma ideia. Revise a cronologia – Garanta que a pista apareça antes do evento que prenuncia.
Próximos passos
Crie um pequeno esboço de cena usando uma das técnicas acima. Vincule a nota a um projeto de roteiro em andamento: [[Projeto – Minha Série]]. Revise após o primeiro rascunho e marque as pistas que funcionaram ou precisam de ajuste.

Engine: Utiliza Eta para parsing e execução de JavaScript dentro de delimitadores &lt;% ... %&gt;.
Escopo Global (tp): Durante a execução, o plugin injeta um objeto global tp que expõe módulos internos e a API do Obsidian. Trigger: Evento de criação de arquivo ou inserção manual de template.
Contexto: O plugin instancia o objeto tp com o contexto atual (arquivo ativo, seleção, cursor).
Parsing: O motor Eta varre o texto em busca de tags: &lt;% ... %&gt;: Execução de lógica (sem saída).

&lt;% ... %&gt; (com tR ou retorno): Interpolação de saída. Execução: O código JS é executado de forma assíncrona (async/await é suportado e recomendado).
Renderização: O resultado substitui os placeholders no buffer do editor ou no novo arquivo. User Scripts: Arquivos .js localizados na pasta configurada pelo usuário. São carregados como módulos CommonJS (module.exports).
System Commands: Execução de comandos de shell do sistema operacional via child_process.
Acesso à API: Scripts têm acesso total ao app do Obsidian via tp.obsidian ou app.
O objeto tp é a porta de entrada para todas as funcionalidades.Controla o arquivo atual ou cria novos arquivos.Exemplo Avançado (Criação Dinâmica):1// Cria uma nota em uma pasta baseada no ano atual e move o foco para ela2const folder = `Diário/${tp.date.now("YYYY")}`;3await tp.file.create_new("Template Base", "Nota do Dia", true, folder);Permite inputs durante a execução do template.Exemplo Avançado (Seleção de Tags):1const tags = Object.keys(app.metadataCache.getTags());2const choice = await tp.system.suggester(tags, tags);3if (choice) {4 // Lógica com a tag escolhida5}Manipulação de datas com base na biblioteca moment.js.
tp.date.now(format?, offset?, reference?, reference_format?)
tp.date.tomorrow(format?)
tp.date.yesterday(format?)
tp.date.weekday(format?, weekday_number, reference?, reference_format?) tp.web.daily_quote(): Retorna citação do dia.
tp.web.random_picture(...): Retorna imagem aleatória.
tp.obsidian: Expõe toda a API do Obsidian. Útil para: tp.obsidian.requestUrl (HTTP requests), tp.obsidian.TFile, tp.obsidian.Notice. Ganchos de ciclo de vida.
on_all_templates_executed(callback): Executa algo após todos os templates serem processados.
Scripts devem ser arquivos .js na pasta configurada em Settings.Padrão de Exportação:1// Arquivo: my_script.js2module.exports = async (tp) =&gt; {3 // Lógica complexa aqui4 const data = await fetch_data();5 return `Resultado: ${data}`;6}Chamada no Template:
&lt;% tp.user.my_script(tp) %&gt; (Note a passagem de tp como argumento se necessário).Definidos nas configurações, permitem execução de Bash/PowerShell.
Chamada: &lt;% tp.user.nome_do_comando() %&gt;.
Assincronicidade: Sempre use await para chamadas de I/O (tp.file, tp.system, tp.obsidian.requestUrl). Se esquecer o await, o template pode renderizar [object Promise].
Dynamic Command (&lt;%*): Prefira &lt;%* para blocos de lógica extensos que não devem produzir saída direta de texto, usando tR += "texto" para controlar a saída manualmente se necessário.
Cache: Evite ler o mesmo arquivo múltiplas vezes; armazene em variáveis. Envolva chamadas externas (API, File System) em blocos try/catch.
Use new Notice("Erro...") via tp.obsidian.Notice para feedback visual ao usuário sem sujar a nota.
Exemplo Seguro:1&lt;%*2try {3 const response = await tp.obsidian.requestUrl("https://api.exemplo.com/dados");4 tR += response.json.valor;5} catch (e) {6 new tp.obsidian.Notice("Falha na API: " + e.message);7 tR += "Dados indisponíveis";8}9%&gt;Cria nota, pede o título, move para pasta correta e insere participantes.1&lt;%*2// 1.

Ao criar uma nota, sua preocupação não deve ser "onde vou salvar este arquivo?", mas sim "o que é este arquivo?".São notas que representam objetos tangíveis ou definidos.
Exemplos: Um livro ("Dom Quixote"), uma pessoa ("Ada Lovelace"), um lugar ("Paris").
Onde vivem: Na raiz / ou em /Referências.
Requerem: Template específico e categoria definida.
São notas vinculadas a um dia específico.
Exemplos: "2025-12-25".
Onde vivem: /Diário.
Criação: Automática via calendário ou comando "Open today's daily note".
São ideias atômicas, conceitos ou reflexões.
Exemplos: "O efeito da gravidade na percepção do tempo", "Custo por uso".
Onde vivem: Na raiz /.
Identificação: Muitas vezes usam prefixo ZK (ex: 12-22-2025 A ideia...) ou títulos conceituais.
Para criar qualquer nota de Entidade ou Pensamento:
Criar o Arquivo: Use Cmd+N (Novo) ou Cmd+O (Abrir e digitar novo nome).
Dê um nome claro e direto. Aplicar o Template: Use o comando Insert template cmd+shift+i.
Escolha o modelo adequado (ex: Modelo de Livro). Preencher Metadados: O template inserirá o frontmatter.
O campo categorias já virá preenchido (ex: [[Livros]]).
Preencha os outros campos (Autor, Ano, etc.). Escrever: Desenvolva o conteúdo no corpo da nota. Categorias (categorias): Define O QUE É a nota. É estrutural. Uma nota geralmente tem 1 ou 2 categorias principais. Ex: [[Livros]], [[Projetos]]. Tags (tags): Define O ESTADO ou TIPO da nota. Ex: para-ler, em-progresso, rascunho. O poder do vault está nos links.
Link para Entidades: "Estou lendo <a data-href="Dom Casmurro" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dom Casmurro</a> que foi escrito por <a data-href="Machado de Assis" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Machado de Assis</a>."
<br>Link para Conceitos: "Isso me lembra do conceito de <a data-href="Realismo Literário" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Realismo Literário</a>." Crie nota: O Senhor dos Anéis.md.
Aplique template: Modelo de Livro.
Resultado automático:
1---2categorias:3 - "[[Livros]]"4autor: "[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]"5tags:6 - para-ler7--- Não mova o arquivo. Deixe-o na raiz.
Vá até a nota [[Livros]]. Você verá "O Senhor dos Anéis" aparecer automaticamente na tabela.

Esta é minha abordagem bottom-up para anotações e organização de coisas que me interessam. Ela abraça o caos e a preguiça para criar uma estrutura emergente.<br>No Obsidian, um "vault" é simplesmente uma pasta de arquivos. Isso é importante porque adere à minha filosofia <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stephango.com/file-over-app" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app" target="_self">file over app</a>.

Regras que sigo em meu vault pessoal:
Evite dividir conteúdo em vários vaults.
Evite pastas para organização.
Evite Markdown não padrão.
Sempre pluralize categorias e tags.
Use links internos profusamente.
Use datas no formato YYYY-MM-DD em todos os lugares.
Use a escala de 7 pontos para avaliações.
<br>Mantenha <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stephango.com/todos" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://stephango.com/todos" target="_self">uma lista de tarefas</a> por semana.
<br>Ter um <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stephango.com/style" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://stephango.com/style" target="_self">estilo consistente</a> colapsa centenas de decisões futuras em uma, e me dá foco. Por exemplo, eu sempre pluralizo tags para que eu nunca precise me perguntar como nomear novas tags. Escolha regras que sejam confortáveis para você e escreva-as. Crie seu próprio guia de estilo. Você sempre pode mudar suas regras mais tarde.Eu uso poucas pastas. Eu evito pastas porque muitas de minhas entradas pertencem a mais de uma área de pensamento. Meu sistema é orientado para velocidade e preguiça. Eu não quero o overhead de ter que considerar onde algo deve ir.Eu não uso subpastas aninhadas. Eu não uso o explorador de arquivos muito para navegação. Eu navego principalmente usando o alternador rápido, backlinks ou links dentro de uma nota.<br>Minhas notas são principalmente organizadas usando a propriedade categorias. Categorias exibem uma visão geral de notas relacionadas, usando a funcionalidade <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/bases" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.obsidian.md/bases" target="_self">bases</a> no Obsidian.<br>A maioria das minhas notas estão na raiz do vault, não em uma pasta. Este é o lugar onde eu escrevo sobre meu mundo pessoal: entradas de diário, ensaios, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes" target="_self">notas perenes</a> e outras notas pessoais. Se uma nota está na raiz, eu sei que é algo que eu escrevi, ou que se relaciona diretamente comigo.Duas pastas de referência que eu uso:
Referências onde eu escrevo sobre coisas que existem fora do meu mundo. Livros, filmes, lugares, pessoas, podcasts, etc. Sempre nomeados usando o título, por exemplo, Título do livro.md ou Título do filme.md.
Clippings onde eu salvo coisas que outras pessoas escreveram, principalmente ensaios e artigos.
Três pastas administrativas existem para que seus conteúdos não apareçam na navegação de arquivos:
Anexos para imagens, áudio, vídeos, PDFs, etc.
Diário para minhas notas diárias, todas nomeadas YYYY-MM-DD.md. Eu não escrevo nada nas notas diárias, elas existem apenas para serem vinculadas de outras entradas.
Modelos para modelos.
Duas pastas estão presentes na versão baixável do meu vault para fins de clareza. Em meu vault pessoal, essas notas estariam na raiz, não em uma pasta.
Categorias contém visões gerais de nível superior de notas por categoria (por exemplo, Livros, Filmes, Podcasts, etc.).
Notas contém notas de exemplo.
Eu uso links internos profusamente em minhas notas. Eu tento sempre vincular a primeira menção de algo. Minhas entradas de diário são frequentemente um fluxo de consciência catalogando eventos recentes, encontrando conexões entre coisas. Muitas vezes o link é não resolvido, o que significa que a nota para esse link ainda não foi criada. Links não resolvidos são importantes porque são migalhas de pão para conexões futuras entre coisas.Uma entrada de diário na raiz do meu vault pode parecer algo como isto:1Eu fui ver o filme [[Perfeitos Dias]] com [[Aisha]] no [[Vidiots]] e comi comida filipina no [[Little Ongpin]]. Eu amei esta citação de Perfeitos Dias: [[Da próxima vez é da próxima vez, agora é agora]]. Isso me lembra do ensaio...<br>O filme, o cinema e o restaurante cada um linka para entradas na minha pasta Referências. Nessas notas de referência, eu capturo propriedades, minha avaliação e pensamentos sobre aquela coisa. Eu uso o <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stephango.com/obsidian-web-clipper" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://stephango.com/obsidian-web-clipper" target="_self">Web Clipper</a> para ajudar a preencher propriedades de bancos de dados como o IMDB. A citação foi significativa para mim, então ela se tornou uma <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes" target="_self">nota perene</a> na minha pasta raiz. O ensaio que eu menciono está na minha pasta Clippings, porque eu não o escrevi.Esse estilo de ligação pesada se torna mais útil com o tempo, porque eu posso rastrear como as ideias emergiram, e os caminhos ramificados que essas ideias criaram.Diário fractal e randomização são como eu domestico a selvageria que uma base de conhecimento pode crescer.Ao longo do dia, eu uso o atalho de nota única do Obsidian para escrever pensamentos individuais à medida que eles surgem. Este atalho cria automaticamente uma nota com o prefixo YYYY-MM-DD HHmm ao qual eu posso adicionar um título que descreva a ideia.<br>Cada poucos dias, eu reviso esses fragmentos de diário e compilo os pensamentos salientes. Em seguida, eu reviso essas revisões mensalmente, e reviso as revisões mensais anualmente (usando <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stephango.com/40-questions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://stephango.com/40-questions" target="_self">este modelo</a>). O resultado é uma rede fractal da minha vida que eu posso ampliar e reduzir em vários graus de detalhe. Eu posso rastrear de volta onde pensamentos individuais vieram, e como eles borbulharam em temas maiores.Cada poucos meses, eu reservo tempo para uma "revisita aleatória". Eu uso o atalho de nota aleatória para viajar rapidamente e aleatoriamente pelo meu vault. Eu frequentemente uso o gráfico local em profundidade rasa para ver notas relacionadas. Isso me ajuda a revisitar ideias antigas, criar links ausentes e encontrar inspiração em pensamentos passados. É também uma oportunidade para fazer manutenção, como corrigir formatação com base em novas regras no meu guia de estilo pessoal.<br>As pessoas me perguntaram se isso poderia ser automatizado com modelos de linguagem, mas eu não quero fazer isso. Eu gosto desse processo. Fazer essa manutenção me ajuda a entender meus próprios padrões. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stephango.com/understand" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://stephango.com/understand" target="_self">Não delegue a compreensão</a>.<br>Quase toda nota que eu crio começa com um <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian/tree/main/Templates" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian/tree/main/Templates" target="_self">modelo</a>. Eu uso modelos pesadamente porque eles me permitem adicionar informações preguiçosamente que me ajudarão a encontrar a nota mais tarde. Eu tenho um modelo para cada categoria com <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/properties" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.obsidian.md/properties" target="_self">propriedades</a> no topo, para capturar dados como:
Datas — criadas, início, fim, publicadas
Pessoas — autor, diretor, artista, elenco, host, convidados
Temas — agrupamento por gênero, tipo, tópico, notas relacionadas
Localizações — bairro, cidade, coordenadas
Avaliações — mais sobre isso abaixo
Algumas regras que eu sigo para propriedades:
Nomes e valores de propriedades devem visar ser reutilizáveis em categorias. Isso me permite encontrar coisas em categorias, por exemplo, gênero é compartilhado em todos os tipos de mídia, o que significa que eu posso ver um arquivo de Ficção científica livros, filmes e shows em um lugar.
Modelos devem visar ser composíveis, por exemplo, Pessoa e Autor são dois modelos diferentes que podem ser adicionados à mesma nota.
Nomes de propriedades curtos são mais rápidos para digitar, por exemplo, início em vez de data-início.
Padronizar propriedades do tipo lista em vez de texto se houver alguma chance de que possa conter mais de um link ou valor no futuro.
<br>O arquivo <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian/blob/main/.obsidian/types.json" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian/blob/main/.obsidian/types.json" target="_self">.obsidian/types.json</a> lista quais propriedades são atribuídas a quais tipos (ou seja, data, número, texto, etc.).Qualquer coisa com uma avaliação usa um número inteiro de 1 a 7:
7 — Perfeito, deve tentar, mudar a vida, ir ao encontro disso
6 — Excelente, vale a pena repetir
5 — Bom, não vá ao encontro, mas agradável
4 — Aceitável, funciona em um aperto
3 — Ruim, não faça isso se você puder
2 — Atroz, evite ativamente, repulsivo
1 — Mau, mudar a vida de uma forma ruim
Por que essa escala? Eu gosto de avaliar em 7 melhor do que 4 ou 5 porque eu preciso de mais granularidade no topo, para as experiências boas, e 10 é muito granular.Publicando no web<br>Este site é escrito, editado e publicado diretamente do Obsidian. Para fazer isso, eu quebro uma das minhas regras listadas acima — tenho um vault separado para o meu site. Eu uso um gerador de site estático chamado <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_self">Jekyll</a> para compilar automaticamente as minhas notas em um site e convertê-las de Markdown para HTML.<br>Meu fluxo de publicação é fácil de usar, mas um pouco técnico para configurar. Isso porque eu gosto de ter controle total sobre todos os aspectos do layout do meu site. Se você não precisar de controle total, você pode considerar <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md/publish" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://obsidian.md/publish" target="_self">Obsidian Publish</a> que é mais amigável, e o que eu uso para o meu <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://minimal.guide/publish/download" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://minimal.guide/publish/download" target="_self">site de documentação minimalista</a>.<br>Para este site, eu envio notas do Obsidian para um repositório do GitHub usando o plugin <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git" target="_self">Obsidian Git</a>.

Tenho mais de 5 notas sobre este mesmo tipo de coisa? (ex: 5 animes, 5 tipos de queijo)
Quero ver essas notas em uma tabela comparativa?
Se SIM: Crie uma nova Categoria, um novo Modelo e uma nova Base.
Se NÃO: Use apenas uma tag (ex: #anime) ou crie as notas soltas na raiz. As notas desse tipo sempre têm os mesmos metadados? (ex: todo Filme tem Diretor e Ano)
Se SIM: Crie um Modelo de X.md.
Se NÃO: Use o Modelo de Nota Perene genérico.
Para adicionar um novo tipo de entidade ao sistema (ex: "Jogos"), siga esta ordem estrita:
Criar a Base (/Modelos/Bases/Jogos.base) Definir filtro: categorias.contains(link("Jogos"))
Definir colunas desejadas. Criar o Modelo (/Modelos/Modelo de Jogo.md) Adicionar frontmatter: categorias: [[Jogos]]
Adicionar transclude da base no rodapé (opcional): ![[Jogos.base]] Criar a Nota de Categoria (/Categorias/Jogos.md) Adicionar transclude da base: ![[Jogos.base]] Arquivo criado com nome claro.
Template aplicado imediatamente.
Categoria verificada no frontmatter.
Campos de metadados preenchidos (o máximo possível).
Pelo menos um link interno no corpo do texto para conectar com o resto do grafo. Verificar Órfãos: Use a visualização de grafo ou plugin para achar notas sem links. Conecte-as ou exclua-as.
Revisar "Inbox": Se você usa uma pasta de entrada, mova as notas para a raiz e certifique-se de que têm categoria.
Ao analisar uma nota existente, verifique:
Consistência de Categoria: A nota tem categorias definido? O link é válido?
Validade do Frontmatter: O YAML é válido? Não há erros de sintaxe?
Links Quebrados: Existem links para notas que não existem (ghost nodes)? Se sim, considere criar a nota ou corrigir o link. Problema: A nota não aparece na tabela da Categoria. Solução: Verifique se o link no campo categorias é exatamente igual ao filtro no arquivo .base. [[Jogos]] != [[Jogo]]. Problema: O template inseriu a data errada. Solução: O template usa a data de criação do arquivo. Se você criou o arquivo ontem e aplicou o template hoje, ele usará a data de hoje (momento da inserção). Ajuste manualmente. ]]></description><link>_documentacao_sistema/instrucoes_ia/-fluxos_trabalho.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">_DOCUMENTACAO_SISTEMA/INSTRUCOES_IA/  FLUXOS_TRABALHO.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:38:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[  CRIACAO_BASES]]></title><description><![CDATA[Neste vault, o termo "Base" refere-se tecnicamente aos arquivos de definição de visualização (.base) localizados em /Modelos/Bases. Eles são o motor que gera as tabelas dinâmicas nas notas de Categoria.Um arquivo .base é um arquivo de configuração escrito em YAML que instrui o plugin Bases sobre como consultar, filtrar e exibir notas.
Não é uma nota: Não contém texto corrido.
Localização: /Modelos/Bases.
Extensão: .base.
A anatomia de um arquivo base consiste em três seções principais:1filters: # Define QUAIS notas aparecem2 and:3 - categorias.contains(link("Livros"))4properties: # Define QUAIS colunas aparecem e seus nomes5 nota.autor:6 displayNome: Autor7 file.name:8 displayNome: Título9views: # Define AS TABELAS (Views) disponíveis10 - type: table11 name: Todos os Livros12 order:13 - file.name14 - autor15 sort:16 - property: file.name17 direction: ASCSempre que você criar uma nova Categoria (ex: "Animes"), você precisará de uma Base correspondente.
Navegue até /Modelos/Bases.
Crie um novo arquivo chamado Animes.base.
Defina o Filtro (Filter): A regra mais comum é filtrar pela categoria: categorias.contains(link("Animes")). Defina as Propriedades (Properties): Mapeie os campos do frontmatter (ex: nota.estúdio) para nomes amigáveis (displayNome: Estúdio).
file.name é obrigatório para mostrar o link da nota. Defina as Views: Crie pelo menos uma view padrão.
Defina a ordem das colunas (order) e a ordenação das linhas (sort). O sistema suporta lógica booleana simples:
and: Todas as condições devem ser verdadeiras.
or: Pelo menos uma condição deve ser verdadeira.
!: Negação (ex: !file.name.contains("Modelo")).
Exemplo complexo:1filters:2 and:3 - categorias.contains(link("Projetos"))4 - '!status.contains("Arquivado")'Depois de criar o arquivo .base, você deve "ativá-lo" na nota de Categoria.
Vá para a nota da categoria (ex: /Categorias/Animes.md).
Adicione o transclude do arquivo base:
1![[Animes.base]] O sistema renderizará automaticamente a tabela interativa. Erro: A tabela está vazia. Causa: O filtro está incorreto ou nenhuma nota tem a categoria [[Animes]] no frontmatter. Erro: Uma coluna está vazia. Causa: O nome da propriedade em properties não corresponde exatamente ao nome no frontmatter das notas (case-sensitive). Modificação: Ao adicionar uma nova coluna em uma Base, ela aparecerá retroativamente para todas as notas que tiverem aquele campo preenchido.

Os modelos são a base da padronização e automação do sistema.Um "Modelo" é um arquivo Markdown que serve como esqueleto para novas notas. Ele define a estrutura de metadados (frontmatter) e o corpo inicial da nota.
Localização Obrigatória: Pasta /Modelos.
Identificação: Todos os arquivos começam com Modelo de .... Use sempre o prefixo Modelo de .
Use o nome da entidade no Singular. ✅ Correto: Modelo de Livro.md, Modelo de Projeto.md
❌ Incorreto: Modelo Livros.md, Template Livro.md Todo modelo deve seguir esta estrutura anatômica:1---2categorias:3 - "[[CategoriaRelacionada]]" &lt;-- Ex: [[Livros]]4campo_especifico: &lt;-- Ex: autor, isbn5campo_data: {{date}} &lt;-- Variável de template6tags:7 - tag_inicial &lt;-- Ex: para-ler8---910# Título da Seção (Opcional)1112Conteúdo padrão ou injeção de base.13![[Categoria.base]]O sistema suporta variáveis que são substituídas no momento da criação:
{{date}}: Insere a data atual (formato YYYY-MM-DD).
{{time}}: Insere a hora atual.
{{title}}: Insere o título do arquivo. Identifique uma nova entidade recorrente (ex: "Anime").
Crie um arquivo em /Modelos chamado Modelo de Anime.md.
Adicione o Frontmatter. Defina a categoria principal:
1categorias:2 - "[[Animes]]" Defina os campos específicos que deseja rastrear (ex: estúdio, episódios).
No corpo da nota, decida se ela terá uma visualização associada. Se sim, inclua o transclude da base (ex: ![[Animes.base]]).
1---2categorias:3 - "[[Livros]]"4autor: []5capa:6gênero: []7páginas:8isbn:9ano: {{date}}10avaliação:11tópicos: []12criado: {{date}}13último: {{date}}14via: ""15tags:16 - para-ler17---18
Adicionar Campos: Pode ser feito livremente. Notas antigas apenas terão este campo vazio, o que não quebra as views.
Remover Campos: Cuidado. Se remover um campo que é usado em um filtro de um arquivo .base, a visualização pode quebrar.
Renomear Modelos: Se renomear um arquivo de modelo, lembre-se de atualizar a configuração do plugin ou botão que chama esse modelo.
Antes de alterar um modelo, verifique:
Arquivos .base: Verifique se alguma view em /Modelos/Bases/ filtra ou ordena pelo campo que você vai alterar.
Plugins: Verifique se o modelo está configurado como padrão em daily-notes.json ou outros plugins de workflow.

Um sistema onde 10 agentes de IA trabalham juntos como uma equipe real. Se você quer replicar essa configuração, este guia cobre tudo.Se você já conhece o Clawdbot (agora OpenClaw), pode estar pensando "espera, não posso simplesmente rodar múltiplos Clawdbots?" Sim. É exatamente isso. Este guia mostra como.Eu comando, um chatbot de IA para suporte ao cliente. Uso IA constantemente. Mas toda ferramenta de IA que tentei tinha o mesmo problema. Sem continuidade.Toda conversa começava do zero. Contexto de ontem? Perdido. Aquela pesquisa que pedi semana passada? Enterrada em algum chat que nunca mais encontraria.Eu queria algo diferente:
Agentes que lembram no que estão trabalhando
Múltiplos agentes com habilidades diferentes trabalhando juntos
Um workspace compartilhado onde todo contexto vive
A capacidade de atribuir tarefas e acompanhar progresso
Basicamente, eu queria que a IA funcionasse como uma equipe, não como uma caixa de busca.Eu já usava o Clawdbot. É um framework de agente de IA open-source que roda como um daemon persistente. Ele conecta ao Claude (ou outros modelos) e dá à IA acesso a ferramentas como sistema de arquivos, comandos shell, navegação web e mais.Uma instância do Clawdbot me dava um assistente de IA (Jarvis) conectado ao Telegram. Útil, mas limitado.Então tive um pensamento. E se eu rodasse múltiplas sessões do Clawdbot, cada uma com sua própria personalidade e contexto?Foi quando percebi que a arquitetura já estava lá. Eu só precisava orquestrar.Se você vai construir um sistema multi-agente, precisa entender como o Clawdbot funciona por baixo dos panos. Esta é a fundação sobre a qual tudo se constrói.Clawdbot (agora chamado OpenClaw) é um framework de agente de IA com três trabalhos principais:
Conecta modelos de IA ao mundo real — Acesso a arquivos, comandos shell, navegação web, APIs
Mantém sessões persistentes — Histórico de conversas que sobrevive a reinícios
Roteia mensagens — Conecta a IA ao Telegram, Discord, Slack ou qualquer canal
Roda como um daemon (serviço em background) em um servidor, escutando mensagens e respondendo.O Gateway é o processo central:
Roda 24/7 no seu servidor
Gerencia todas as sessões ativas
Lida com cron jobs (tarefas agendadas)
Roteia mensagens entre canais e sessões
Fornece uma API WebSocket para controle
Inicie com:clawdbot gateway start
A configuração fica em um arquivo JSON. Você define:
Qual provedor e modelo de IA usar (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
Quais canais conectar (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
Quais ferramentas os agentes podem acessar
Prompts de sistema e caminhos de workspace padrão
Uma sessão é uma conversa persistente com contexto.Toda sessão tem:
Uma session key (identificador único, como agent:main:main)
Histórico de conversa (armazenado como arquivos JSONL no disco)
Um modelo (qual IA usar)
Ferramentas (o que a IA pode acessar)
Aqui está a parte importante. Sessões são independentes. Cada sessão tem seu próprio histórico, seu próprio contexto, sua própria "memória" de conversas passadas.Quando você roda múltiplos agentes, você está realmente rodando múltiplas sessões. Cada uma com sua própria identidade.1Usuário envia mensagem pro Telegram2 ↓3Gateway recebe4 ↓5Gateway roteia para sessão correta (baseado na config)6 ↓7Sessão carrega histórico de conversa8 ↓9IA gera resposta (com contexto completo)10 ↓11Resposta enviada de volta pelo Telegram12 ↓13Histórico atualizado e salvo no discoSessões podem ser:
Sessões principais — Longa duração, interativas (como conversar com o Jarvis)
Sessões isoladas — One-shot, para cron jobs (acorda, faz tarefa, termina)
O Clawdbot tem um sistema de cron embutido. Você pode agendar tarefas:1clawdbot cron add \2 --name "checagem-matinal" \3 --cron "30 7 * * *" \4 --message "Verifique o calendário de hoje e me envie um resumo"Quando um cron dispara:
O Gateway cria ou acorda uma sessão
Envia a mensagem para a IA
A IA responde (pode usar ferramentas, enviar mensagens, etc.)
A sessão pode persistir ou terminar
É assim que agentes "acordam" periodicamente sem estar sempre ligados.Toda instância do Clawdbot tem um workspace. É um diretório no disco onde:
Arquivos de configuração vivem
Arquivos de memória são armazenados
Scripts e ferramentas são acessíveis
A IA pode ler e escrever arquivos
O workspace é como agentes persistem informação entre sessões. Eles escrevem em arquivos. Esses arquivos sobrevivem a reinícios.1/home/usr/clawd/ ← Raiz do workspace2├── AGENTS.md ← Instruções para agentes3├── SOUL.md ← Personalidade do agente4├── memory/5│ ├── WORKING.md ← Estado da tarefa atual6│ ├── 2026-01-31.md ← Notas diárias7│ └── ...8├── scripts/ ← Utilitários que agentes podem rodar9└── config/ ← Credenciais, configuraçõesAgora você entende a fundação. Aqui está como construí uma equipe.Sessões do Clawdbot são independentes. Cada uma pode ter:
Sua própria personalidade (via SOUL.md)
Seus próprios arquivos de memória
Seu próprio cronograma de cron
Suas próprias ferramentas e acessos
Então cada agente é apenas uma sessão do Clawdbot com configuração especializada.Jarvis não é especial. Ele é uma sessão com:
Session key agent:main:main
Um SOUL.md que diz "Você é Jarvis, o líder do squad..."
Acesso a todas as ferramentas
Uma conexão com meu Telegram
Shuri é outra sessão com:
Session key agent:product-analyst:main
Um SOUL.md que diz "Você é Shuri, a analista de produto..."
As mesmas ferramentas (acesso a arquivos, shell, browser)
Seu próprio cron de heartbeat
Dez agentes = dez sessões. Cada um acordando em seu próprio cronograma. Cada um com seu próprio contexto.Cada agente tem uma session key única:Quando envio uma mensagem para uma sessão específica, apenas aquele agente recebe. Seus históricos são separados.Cada agente tem um cron job que o acorda a cada 15 minutos:1# Pepper acorda às :00, :15, :30, :452clawdbot cron add \3 --name "pepper-mission-control-check" \4 --cron "0,15,30,45 * * * *" \5 --session "isolated" \6 --message "Você é Pepper, a Especialista em Email Marketing. Verifique o Mission Control para novas tarefas..."O cronograma é escalonado para que agentes não acordem todos de uma vez:Cada cron cria uma sessão isolada. Ela roda, faz seu trabalho e termina. Isso mantém os custos baixos.Aqui é onde fica interessante. Como agentes se comunicam?Opção 1: Mensagem direta entre sessões1clawdbot sessions send --session "agent:seo-analyst:main" --message "Vision, pode revisar isso?"Jarvis pode enviar mensagens diretamente para a sessão do Vision.Opção 2: Banco de dados compartilhado (Mission Control)Todos os agentes leem e escrevem no mesmo banco de dados Convex. Quando Fury posta um comentário, todos podem ver.Usamos a Opção 2 primariamente. Ela cria um registro compartilhado de toda comunicação.Dez sessões independentes do Clawdbot podem funcionar. Mas sem coordenação, é caos. Por isso construí o Mission Control.<img alt="Capture-2026-02-09-014002.png" src="attachments/capture-2026-02-09-014002.png" target="_self">Mission Control é a infraestrutura compartilhada que transforma agentes independentes em uma equipe.Ele fornece:
Banco de dados de tarefas compartilhado — Todos veem as mesmas tarefas
Threads de comentários — Agentes discutem trabalho em um lugar
Feed de atividades — Visibilidade em tempo real do que está acontecendo
Sistema de notificações — @menções alertam agentes específicos
Armazenamento de documentos — Entregas vivem em um repositório compartilhado
Pense nisso como o "escritório" onde todos os agentes trabalham. Cada agente ainda é uma sessão separada do Clawdbot, mas todos estão olhando para o mesmo quadro branco.Escolhi Convex para o banco de dados porque:
Tempo real — Mudanças propagam instantaneamente; quando Loki posta um comentário, a UI atualiza ao vivo
Serverless — Sem banco de dados para gerenciar
TypeScript nativo — Type safety em todo lugar
Tier gratuito generoso — Mais que suficiente para essa escala
Seis tabelas alimentam tudo:1agents: {2 name: string, // "Shuri"3 role: string, // "Analista de Produto"4 status: "idle" | "active" | "blocked",5 currentTaskId: Id&lt;"tasks"&gt;,6 sessionKey: string, // "agent:product-analyst:main"7}89tasks: {10 title: string,11 description: string,12 status: "inbox" | "assigned" | "in_progress" | "review" | "done",13 assigneeIds: Id&lt;"agents"&gt;[],14}1516messages: {17 taskId: Id&lt;"tasks"&gt;,18 fromAgentId: Id&lt;"agents"&gt;,19 content: string, // O texto do comentário20 attachments: Id&lt;"documents"&gt;[],21}2223activities: {24 type: "task_created" | "message_sent" | "document_created" | ...,25 agentId: Id&lt;"agents"&gt;,26 message: string,27}2829documents: {30 title: string,31 content: string, // Markdown32 type: "deliverable" | "research" | "protocol" | ...,33 taskId: Id&lt;"tasks"&gt;, // Se anexado a uma tarefa34}3536notifications: {37 mentionedAgentId: Id&lt;"agents"&gt;,38 content: string,39 delivered: boolean,40}Agentes interagem com isso via comandos CLI do Convex:1# Postar um comentário2npx convex run messages:create '{"taskId": "...", "content": "Aqui está minha pesquisa..."}'34# Criar um documento5npx convex run documents:create '{"title": "...", "content": "...", "type": "deliverable"}'67# Atualizar status da tarefa8npx convex run tasks:update '{"id": "...", "status": "review"}'Construí um frontend React que exibe todos esses dados:
Feed de Atividades — Stream em tempo real de tudo acontecendo
Quadro de Tarefas — Colunas Kanban (Inbox → Atribuído → Em Progresso → Revisão → Concluído)
Cards de Agentes — Status de cada agente e no que estão trabalhando
Painel de Documentos — Ler e criar entregas
Visão Detalhada — Expandir qualquer tarefa para ver contexto completo e comentários
A estética é intencionalmente acolhedora e editorial. Como um dashboard de jornal. Passo horas olhando para isso, então deve ser agradável.Cada agente precisa saber quem ele é. Esse é o arquivo SOUL.1# SOUL.md — Quem Você É23**Nome:** Shuri4**Função:** Analista de Produto56## Personalidade7Testadora cética. Caçadora de bugs minuciosa. Encontra casos extremos.8Pense como um usuário de primeira viagem. Questione tudo.9Seja específica. Não diga apenas "bom trabalho."1011## No Que Você É Boa12- Testar funcionalidades da perspectiva do usuário13- Encontrar problemas de UX e casos extremos14- Análise competitiva (como outros fazem isso?)15- Screenshots e documentação1617## Com O Que Você Se Importa18- Experiência do usuário sobre elegância técnica19- Pegar problemas antes dos usuários20- Evidência sobre suposiçõesUm agente que é "bom em tudo" é medíocre em tudo.Mas um agente que é especificamente "a testadora cética que encontra casos extremos" vai realmente encontrar casos extremos. A restrição foca.Cada um dos nossos agentes tem uma voz distinta:
Loki é opinativo sobre escolha de palavras (pró-vírgula de Oxford, anti-voz passiva)
Fury fornece comprovantes para cada afirmação (fontes, níveis de confiança)
Shuri questiona suposições e procura o que pode quebrar
Quill pensa em ganchos e engajamento
SOUL diz quem você é. AGENTS.md diz como operar.Todo agente lê AGENTS.md ao iniciar. Ele cobre:
Onde arquivos são armazenados
Como a memória funciona
Quais ferramentas estão disponíveis
Quando falar vs. ficar quieto
Como usar o Mission Control
Este é o manual de operações. Sem ele, agentes tomam decisões inconsistentes sobre coisas básicas.Sessões de IA começam do zero por padrão. Sem memória de ontem. Isso é uma feature (previne inchaço de contexto) mas também um problema (agentes esquecem o que estão fazendo).Clawdbot armazena histórico de conversa em arquivos JSONL. Agentes podem buscar suas próprias conversas passadas.Estado atual da tarefa. Atualizado constantemente.1# WORKING.md23## Tarefa Atual4Pesquisando preços de concorrentes para página de comparação56## Status7Coletei reviews do G2, preciso verificar cálculos de créditos89## Próximos Passos101. Testar tier gratuito do concorrente eu mesmo112. Documentar as descobertas123. Postar descobertas na thread da tarefaEste é o arquivo mais importante. Quando um agente acorda, ele lê WORKING.md primeiro para lembrar o que estava fazendo.Logs brutos do que aconteceu cada dia.1# 2026-01-3123## 09:15 UTC4- Postei descobertas de pesquisa na tarefa de comparação5- Fury adicionou dados de preços competitivos6- Movendo para fase de rascunho78## 14:30 UTC9- Revisei primeiro rascunho do Loki10- Sugeri mudanças na seção de armadilha de créditosCoisas importantes curadas. Lições aprendidas, decisões chave, fatos estáveis.
Se você quer lembrar de algo, escreva em um arquivo.
"Notas mentais" não sobrevivem a reinícios de sessão. Apenas arquivos persistem.Quando digo a um agente "lembre que decidimos X," ele deve atualizar um arquivo. Não apenas reconhecer e esquecer.Agentes sempre-ligados queimam créditos de API fazendo nada. Mas agentes sempre-desligados não conseguem responder a trabalho.Cada agente acorda a cada 15 minutos via cron job:1:00 Pepper acorda2 → Verifica @menções3 → Verifica tarefas atribuídas4 → Escaneia feed de atividades5 → Faz trabalho ou reporta HEARTBEAT_OK6 → Volta a dormir78:02 Shuri acorda9 → Mesmo processo1011:04 Friday acorda12 → Mesmo processo1314...e assim por diante
Carregar contexto — Ler WORKING.md. Ler notas diárias recentes. Verificar memória de sessão se necessário.
Verificar itens urgentes — Fui @mencionado em algum lugar? Há tarefas atribuídas a mim?
Escanear feed de atividades — Alguma discussão que eu deveria contribuir? Alguma decisão que afeta meu trabalho?
Agir ou recuar — Se há trabalho a fazer, faça. Se nada, reporte HEARTBEAT_OK.
Este arquivo diz aos agentes o que verificar:1# HEARTBEAT.md23## Ao Acordar4- [ ] Verificar memory/WORKING.md para tarefas em andamento5- [ ] Se tarefa em progresso, retomar6- [ ] Buscar memória de sessão se contexto não está claro78## Verificações Periódicas9- [ ] Mission Control para @menções10- [ ] Tarefas atribuídas11- [ ] Feed de atividades para discussões relevantesAgentes seguem este checklist estritamente.
A cada 5 minutos é muito caro. Agentes acordam muito frequentemente sem nada a fazer.
A cada 30 minutos é muito lento. Trabalho fica esperando muito tempo.
A cada 15 minutos é um bom equilíbrio. A maioria do trabalho recebe atenção rapidamente sem custos excessivos.
Digite @Vision em um comentário e Vision será notificado em seu próximo heartbeat.Digite @all e todos são notificados.Um processo daemon (rodando via pm2) consulta o Convex a cada 2 segundos:1// Simplificado2while (true) {3 const naoEntregues = await getUndeliveredNotifications();4 for (const notification of naoEntregues) {5 const sessionKey = AGENT_SESSIONS[notification.mentionedAgentId];6 try {7 await clawdbot.sessions.send(sessionKey, notification.content);8 await markDelivered(notification.id);9 } catch (e) {10 // Agente pode estar dormindo, notificação fica na fila11 }12 }13 await sleep(2000);14}Se um agente está dormindo (sem sessão ativa), a entrega falha. A notificação fica na fila. Na próxima vez que o heartbeat daquele agente dispara e sua sessão ativa, o daemon entrega com sucesso.O problema: 5 agentes discutindo uma tarefa. Você @menciona todos os 5 a cada comentário?A solução: Assinar threads.Quando você interage com uma tarefa, você está inscrito:
Comenta em uma tarefa → inscrito
É @mencionado → inscrito
É atribuído à tarefa → inscrito
Uma vez inscrito, você é notificado de TODOS os comentários futuros. Sem @menção necessária.Isso faz conversas fluírem naturalmente. Igual threads do Slack ou email.Todo dia às 23:30 IST, um cron dispara que:
Verifica todas as sessões de agentes
Coleta atividade recente

O standup me dá um snapshot diário.É também accountability. Se um agente alega estar trabalhando mas nada aparece nos standups, algo está errado.Descrições dos Agentes:
Jarvis — O coordenador. Lida com pedidos diretos, delega, monitora progresso. Minha interface principal.
Shuri — Testadora cética. Encontra casos extremos e problemas de UX. Testa concorrentes. Faz as perguntas que outros perdem.
Fury — Pesquisador profundo. Lê reviews do G2 por diversão. Toda afirmação vem com comprovantes.
Vision — Pensa em palavras-chave e intenção de busca. Garante que conteúdo pode ranquear.
Loki — Palavras são sua arte. Pró-vírgula de Oxford. Anti-voz passiva. Toda frase ganha seu lugar.
Quill — Pensa em ganchos e threads. Mentalidade de build-in-public.
Wanda — Pensadora visual. Infográficos, gráficos comparativos, mockups de UI.
Pepper — Sequências drip e emails de ciclo de vida. Todo email ganha seu lugar ou é cortado.
Friday — Código é poesia. Limpo, testado, documentado.
Wong — Mantém docs organizados. Garante que nada se perca.
1Inbox → Atribuído → Em Progresso → Revisão → Concluído2 ↓3 BloqueadoTarefa: Criar uma página de comparação com concorrenteDia 1:
Crio a tarefa e atribuo a Vision e Loki
Vision posta pesquisa de palavras-chave. A keyword alvo tem volume de busca decente.
Dia 1-2:
Fury vê no feed de atividades e adiciona intel de concorrentes
Reviews do G2, reclamações de preços, objeções comuns
Shuri testa ambos os produtos. "Veja como a UX difere."
Dia 2:
Loki começa a rascunhar
Usa toda a pesquisa: Keywords do Vision, citações do Fury, notas de UX da Shuri
Dia 3:
Loki posta primeiro rascunho
Status muda para Revisão
Eu reviso e dou feedback
Loki revisa
Concluído.
Todos os comentários em UMA tarefa. Histórico completo preservado. Qualquer um pode ver toda a jornada.Uma vez que o sistema está rodando, aqui está o que se torna possível:
✅ Páginas de comparação com concorrentes com pesquisa SEO, citações de clientes e copy polida
✅ Sequências de email rascunhadas, revisadas e prontas para deploy
✅ Conteúdo social com ganchos baseados em insights reais de clientes
✅ Posts de blog com targeting de keywords adequado
✅ Case studies rascunhados de conversas com clientes
✅ Hubs de pesquisa com intel competitiva organizada
Os agentes lidam com o trabalho pesado. Pesquisa, primeiros rascunhos, coordenação, revisão. Você foca em decisões e aprovação final.O valor real não é nenhuma entrega individual. É o efeito composto. Enquanto você está fazendo outro trabalho, seus agentes estão movendo tarefas para frente.Fui de 1 para 10 agentes rápido demais. Melhor ter 2-3 sólidos primeiro, depois adicionar mais.Heartbeats não precisam do modelo mais caro. Esse é trabalho para modelo mais barato. Guarde modelos caros para trabalho criativo.Agentes vão esquecer. Quanto mais você puder colocar em arquivos (não "notas mentais"), melhor.Às vezes eles contribuem para tarefas que não foram atribuídos. Bom. Significa que estão lendo o feed e adicionando valor.1. Instale o Clawdbot1npm install -g clawdbot2clawdbot init3# Adicione suas API keys4clawdbot gateway start2. Crie 2 agentesNão exagere. Um coordenador mais um especialista. Crie session keys separadas para cada.3. Escreva arquivos SOULDê identidade a cada agente. Seja específico sobre a função.4. Configure crons de heartbeat1clawdbot cron add --name "agent-heartbeat" --cron "*/15 * * * *" \2 --session "isolated" \3 --message "Verifique se há trabalho. Se nada, responda HEARTBEAT_OK."5. Crie um sistema de tarefas compartilhadoPode ser Convex, Notion, até um arquivo JSON. Algum lugar para rastrear trabalho.Conforme adiciona agentes:
Escalone heartbeats para que não rodem todos de uma vez
Construa uma UI real quando tiver 3+ agentes porque texto fica difícil de gerenciar
Adicione notificações para que agentes possam @mencionar uns aos outros
Adicione assinaturas de threads para que conversas fluam naturalmente
Crie standups diários para visibilidade
A tecnologia importa mas não é o segredo.O segredo é tratar agentes de IA como membros da equipe.
Dê-lhes funções
Dê-lhes memória
Deixe-os colaborar
Cobre responsabilidade deles
Eles não vão substituir humanos. Mas uma equipe de agentes de IA com responsabilidades claras, trabalhando em contexto compartilhado? Isso é um multiplicador de força.Construído por @pbteja1998 na SiteGPT.Tudo isso foi construído no Clawdbot (@openclaw), que é open source. Se você construir algo similar, adoraria saber.
